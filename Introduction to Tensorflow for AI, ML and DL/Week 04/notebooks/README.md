# Note

If you want to run the first three notebooks offline, you need to download the data used for these notebooks. You can download the training data from [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/horse-or-human.zip) and the validation data from [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/validation-horse-or-human.zip). Their size is around 160MB both. After downloading them, you should be ready to run the first three notebooks on your device.
