# TensorFlow in Practice Specialization 
This repo contains my solution to the "TensorFlow From Basics to Mastery" specialization on Coursera made by Andrew Ng. and Laurence Moroney. You can check the whole specialization from the official website of deeplearning.ai [here](https://www.deeplearning.ai/tensorflow-from-basics-to-mastery/) or on Coursera right [here](https://www.coursera.org/collections/tensorflow-deeplearning-ai).

# Introduction 
If you are a software developer who wants to build scalable AI-powered algorithms, you need to understand how to use the tools to build them. This Specialization will teach you best practices for using TensorFlow, a popular open-source framework for machine learning. In these courses you will:

- Learn how to build machine learning models in TensorFlow
- Build image recognition algorithms with deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks
- Understand how to deploy your models on mobile and the web
- Go beyond image recognition into object detection, text recognition, and more
- Expand the basic APIs for custom learning/training

**The solutions have been uploaded for personal academic purposes and can be used as a reference by others (but I strongly recommend trying out the assignments on your own).**


The Specialization has 4 Courses:

- Course 1: Introduction to Tensorflow for AI, ML and DL
- Course 2: Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
- Course 3: Natural Language Processing in Tensoflow
- Course 4: Sequences, Time series and Prediction
