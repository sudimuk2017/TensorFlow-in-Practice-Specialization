# TensorFlow 2.0 "from Basics to Mastery"
This repo contains my solution to the "TensorFlow From Basics to Mastery" specialization on Coursera made by Andrew Ng. and Laurence Moroney. You can check the whole specialization from the official website of deeplearning.ai [here](https://www.deeplearning.ai/tensorflow-from-basics-to-mastery/) or on Coursera right [here](https://www.coursera.org/collections/tensorflow-deeplearning-ai).



If you are a software developer who wants to build scalable AI-powered algorithms, you need to understand how to use the tools to build them. This Specialization will teach you best practices for using TensorFlow, a popular open-source framework for machine learning. In these courses you will:

- Learn how to build machine learning models in TensorFlow
- Build image recognition algorithms with deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks
- Understand how to deploy your models on mobile and the web
- Go beyond image recognition into object detection, text recognition, and more
- Expand the basic APIs for custom learning/training

The full Specialization will be available later this year (2019), till now there is only two courses:

- Course 1: Introduction to Tensorflow for AI, ML and DL
- Course 2: Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow



## About the Instructors

- **Andrew Ng** is a global leader in AI and co-founder of Coursera. Dr. Ng is also the CEO and founder of deeplearning.ai and founder of Landing AI. He is an Adjunct Professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University.

  He was until recently Chief Scientist at Baidu, where he was responsible for driving the company’s global AI strategy and infrastructure. He was also the founding lead of the Google Brain team. Dr. Ng has authored or co-authored over 100 research papers in machine learning, robotics and related fields. He holds degrees from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT and the University of California, Berkeley.

- **Laurence Moroney** is a Developer Advocate at Google working on Artificial Intelligence with TensorFlow. As the author of more programming books than he can count, he’s excited to be working with deeplearning.ai and Coursera in producing video training.

  When not working with technology, he’s a member of the Science Fiction Writers of America, having authored several science fiction novels, a produced screenplay and comic books, including the prequel to the movie ‘Equilibrium’ starring Christian Bale. Laurence is based in Washington State, where he drinks way too much coffee.
