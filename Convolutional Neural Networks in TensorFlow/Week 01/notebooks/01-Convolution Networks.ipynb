In this lesson you'll take that to the next level, recognizing real images of Cats and Dogs in order to classify an incoming image as one or the other. In particular the handwriting recognition made your life a little easier by having all the images be the same size and shape, and they were all monochrome color. Real-world images aren't like that -- they're in different shapes, aspect ratios etc, and they're usually in color!\n",
