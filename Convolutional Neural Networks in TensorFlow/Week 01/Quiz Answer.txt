1) All of the above

2) 148x148

3) 75x75

4) Create a variable ‘history’ and assign it to the return of model.fit or model.fit_generator

5) The model.layers API

6) A bigger training set would give us better validation accuracy

7) The validation accuracy is based on images that the model hasn't been trained with, and thus a better indicator of how the model will perform with new images.

8) Because there's less likelihood of all possible features being encountered in the training process.
